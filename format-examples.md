Phone numbers vary greatly by geographic region, and whether or not you are calling from within that region or not.

e.g.
input: "2125551234"
output: "(212) 555-1234"

Based on the NANPA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan
The **NPA** (Numbering Plan Area Code) is "212" (Manhattan, NY, USA)
The **NXX** (Central Office Exchange Code) is "555"
The **XXX** (Subscriber Number) is "1234"

The generally accepted format is:
"(NPA) NXX-XXXX"
